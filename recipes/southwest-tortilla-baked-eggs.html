        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 8" flour tortilla</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp diced green chiles</li> 
            <li>4 large eggs</li> 
            <li>1/8 tsp salt</li> 
            <li>1/8 tsp pepper</li> 
            <li>2 tbsp salsa</li> 
            <li>1 green onion, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF. Brush the olive oil over the inside surface of a circular baking dish.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Press the tortilla down into the baking dish so that the edges fold up the sides of the dish. It may help to microwave the tortilla for a few seconds first to make it more pliable.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Sprinkle 1/2 of the shredded cheddar into the bottom of the tortilla. Dice the bell pepper and add it on top of the cheese along with the diced green chiles.</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Crack four eggs into the dish on top of the vegetables and cheese. Season with a pinch fo salt and pepper.</p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>Top with the remaining shredded cheese.</p>
            <li>Step 6</li>
            <p>Bake the eggs for about 20 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still a bit liquid. You can shake the dish a bit to easily see how much the eggs are set.</p>
            <li>Step 7</li>
            <p>After baking, spoon a couple tablespoons of salsa over the tortilla baked eggs and sprinkle the sliced green onion over top.</p>
            <li>Step 8</li>
            <p>Loosen the tortilla by sliding a knife around the edge between the tortilla and dish, then slide the tortilla baked eggs out of the dish and use a large knife to cut it into quarters. Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
