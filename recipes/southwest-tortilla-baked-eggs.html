            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p><span>Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF.</span> <span>Brush the olive oil over the inside surface of a circular baking dish.</span></p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p><span>Press the tortilla down into the baking dish so that the edges fold up the sides of the dish.</span> <span>It may help to microwave the tortilla for a few seconds first to make it more pliable.</span></p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p><span>Sprinkle 1/2 of the shredded cheddar into the bottom of the tortilla.</span> <span>Dice the bell pepper and add it on top of the cheese along with the diced green chiles.</span></p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p><span>Crack four eggs into the dish on top of the vegetables and cheese.</span> <span>Season with a pinch fo salt and pepper.</span></p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p><span>Top with the remaining shredded cheese.</span></p>
            <li>Step 6</li>
            <p><span>Bake the eggs for about 20 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still a bit liquid.</span> <span>You can shake the dish a bit to easily see how much the eggs are set.</span></p>
            <li>Step 7</li>
            <p><span>After baking, spoon a couple tablespoons of salsa over the tortilla baked eggs and sprinkle the sliced green onion over top.</span></p>
            <li>Step 8</li>
            <p><span>Loosen the tortilla by sliding a knife around the edge between the tortilla and dish, then slide the tortilla baked eggs out of the dish and use a large knife to cut it into quarters.</span> <span>Serve hot and enjoy!</span></p>
